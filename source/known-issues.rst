Zapier Basic
------------

If you are using the free basic version of Zapier. There is a one second run-time limit. \
If the code exceeds this limit you will receive a warning notice. In my experience this \
has not caused any issues with the actual execution of the code.

It appears that Zapier has also extended the time between runs. It used to be 5 minutes. \
It is now 15 minutes for the free account.
